VienneseMaze
============

Implimenting a visualization of mazes found in this blog http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/04/27/viennese-mazes-what-they-are/

I wanted to see how much easier it would be to solve the first maze if it was interactive. The answer? Way easier.

I would love to expand this to actually generate the mazes, but this was just a quick project.
